# Invited Talks

## Andrew Crouse

**What is another word for synonym? The value of NLP data and its challenges: a user’s perspective**

*Dr. Crouse has been working on biomedical research for a decade and a half including industry, non-profit, and now academic research. His background is in molecular biology and genetics. Currently, as director of research for the Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, he has been assisting in the development of programs utilizing knowledge graphs of biomedical information to help find therapeutic options for patients with rare genetic disorders. They rely heavily on knowledge set developed through applying NLP on all of PubMed. Dr. Crouse will discuss the value and the challenges associated with using the NLP data.*

## [Marti Hearst](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/)

**Broadening Access to Scientific Research via NLP-Enhanced User Interfaces**

Key to understanding the latest developments in AI and other branches of science is being able to comprehend what is written in research papers. Even experienced researchers are having trouble keeping up with the literature, and the mathematical content of machine learning papers can be especially challenging for those less familiar with technical content.   To help broaden access to the scientific literate, the ScholarPhi project -- a collaboration between UC Berkeley, AI2, and U Washington -- has been developing new user interfaces for improving the reading of scientific articles.  This includes context-relevant explanations of technical terms and notation, and eventually, tools to improve the writing of such papers.
Scientific scholarly text presents numerous challenges to NLP algorithms, many of which do not work with high accuracy on this complex data source.   Our efforts have uncovered interesting language phenomena, and led to innovations in NLP algorithm design.  It has also underscored the especially difficult task of annotating language phenomena in this domain.  In this talk I will discuss these and other challenges to help inspire research in this important and exciting domain.
This research is supported by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and AI2.

*Marti Hearst is a Professor at UC Berkeley in the School of Information and the Computer Science Division. Her research encompasses user interfaces with a focus on search, information visualization with a focus on text, computational linguistics, and educational technology. She is the author of Search User Interfaces, the first academic book on that topic. She is a former President of the Association for Computational Linguistics, a member of the CHI Academy, the SIGIR Academy, an ACM Fellow, and has received four Excellence in Teaching Awards from the students of UC Berkeley. She received her PhD, MS, and BA degrees in Computer Science from UC Berkeley and was a member of the research staff at Xerox PARC.*

## [Maria Liakata](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/maria-liakata)

**Towards automatically understanding and measuring the contributions of scientific work**

Researchers in NLP have been working on the automatic extraction of information from scientific articles for over two decades. A key aspect in this line of research is capturing how scientists discuss their work, the scientific discourse. I will give a brief overview of early work on identifying the scientific discourse and how this can improve downstream tasks involving the extraction of information from the scientific literature. I will then present more recent work on the relation between the scientific discourse and the way it is represented in the news as a step towards understanding the more comprehensive (non-academic) impact of scientific work.

*Maria Liakata is a Turing AI fellow and Professor in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London. She is also honorary Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick. At the Turing she founded and co-leads the NLP and data science for mental health special interest groups and supervises PhD students.  Maria is in receipt of a five year EPSRC/UKRI Turing AI Fellowship which involves developing new methods for NLP and multi-modal data to allow the creation of [longitudinal personalized language monitoring](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/time-sensitive-sensing-language-and-user-generated-content). She is also the co-PI of projects on Mobile Sensing of Altered EveryDay Function in Early Alzheimer’s Disease (MEDEA), "Language sensing for dementia monitoring & diagnosis", "Opinion summarization from social media", "PANACEA: An AI-enabled evidence-driven framework for claim veracity assessment during pandemics". She leads a team of 5 RAs and 8 PhD students.*

## [Zhiyong Lu](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/Zhiyong-Lu)

**Biomedical Text Mining for Knowledge Discovery**

The explosion of biomedical big data and information in the past decade or so has created new opportunities for discoveries to improve the treatment and prevention of human diseases. But the large body of knowledge — which mostly exists as free text in journal articles for humans to read — presents a grand new challenge: individual scientists around the world are increasingly finding themselves overwhelmed by the sheer volume of research literature and are struggling to keep up to date and to make sense of this wealth of textual information. Our research aims to break down this barrier and to empower scientists towards accelerated knowledge discovery. In this talk, I will present our work on developing large-scale, machine-learning based tools for better understanding scientific text in the biomedical literature. Moreover, I will demonstrate their uses in some real-world applications such as improving PubMed searches, scaling up data curation with PubTator, and taming COVID-19 pandemic paper tsunami in LitCovid.

*Dr. Zhiyong Lu is a Senior Investigator at the National Library of Medicine’s (NLM) [Intramural Research Program](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/staff-index.html), leading research in biomedical text and image processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. As Deputy Director for Literature Search at the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Dr. Lu also directs the overall R&D efforts to improve literature search and information access (e.g. PubMed Search; LitCovid). Over the years, Dr. Lu has mentored over 40 trainees and is a highly cited author with ~300 peer-reviewed articles. Dr. Lu is a Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI), Associate Editor of Bioinformatics, and Organizer of the BioCreative challenge series.*

## [Jevin D. West](https://www.jevinwest.org/)

**Mapping Latent Knowledge**

The collective knowledge of humankind is assembled in an academic literature composed of tens of millions of articles and scholarly books. This primary knowledge is immeasurably valuable if one knows where to look. However, navigating the literature can be extraordinarily difficult due to its vast volume and antiquated systems of organization. To leverage this primary knowledge, researchers require a higher level of latent knowledge: familiarity with the key documents in a research area; an understanding of how to interpret individual documents in light of broader research paradigms; a mental map of the relations among fields and their core concepts; a knowledge of the specialist jargon needed for effective retrieval of particular research threads. To date, a scholar could acquire this sort of understanding only through long experience within a field. It is not laid out clearly in any classic text, nor can it be, for it maps a continually changing terrain. Given these challenges, how do we develop a semantic search that both captures and expedites the construction of this latent knowledge? Using examples from my own research and research of others, I will explore this question and point to potential future directions within the SciNLP community.

*Jevin D. West is an Associate Professor in the Information School at the University of Washington. He is the Director of the new Center for an Informed Public at UW aimed at resisting strategic misinformation, promoting an informed society and strengthening democratic discourse. He is also the co-founder of the DataLab at UW, a Data Science Fellow at the eScience Institute, and Affiliate Faculty for the Center for Statistics & Social Sciences. His research and teaching focus on the impact of technology on science and society, with a focus on slowing the spread of misinformation.

# Topics of Interest

The primary goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse fields who are interested in building computational systems that extract, represent the knowledge in scientific texts, and/or provide humans better access to such knowledge. 

Accordingly, the focus of this year’s SciNLP will be **Understanding Scientific Text**, and we welcome discussions about research that falls under this focus area, including those describing work-in-progress. Examples of such research include, but are not limited to:

- **Methods** in natural language processing for extracting and representing knowledge from scientific text (e.g. information extraction, entity normalization, discourse analysis, parsing, knowledge base construction, weak/distant supervision, crowdsourcing), especially in low resource scenarios that are common while processing scientific texts
- **Applications** of these methods to improving scientific knowledge discovery and/or understanding (e.g. summarization, text generation, translation, question answering, automated literature review, search and recommender systems, techniques for data exploration and visualization),
- **Fairness** (e.g. augmented or assistive paper reading, concept simplification, scientific education and literacy),
- **Science of science** studies (in particular, studies that shed light on phenomena that can motivate future research in above-mentioned areas), and
- **Datasets**, **Resources** (e.g. treebanks, knowledge bases), and **Tools** (e.g. software libraries, annotation interfaces) for conducting research in such areas, especially for supporting research in underserved areas (e.g. SciNLP on non-English papers).

We welcome research relevant to processing text in any domain of science (e.g. Biology, Medicine, Computer Science, Physics, Economics, Sociology, etc.) that can come from a variety of text sources (e.g. scholarly papers, surveys and technical reports, patents, tweets by scholars, blogs/tutorials, etc.)

The goal of SciNLP is to promote scientific literature (not just news & wiki) as a serious domain of NLP. We would like the workshop to provide a forum for researchers in this field to discover new advances on scientific text understanding, get feedback on early work, and identify existing research gaps and collaboration opportunities.

If you are unsure about whether your work is relevant to our workshop, please reach out to us at **scinlp@googlegroups.com**

There is a fee of $30 for students and $50 for non-students.  Registering gives you access to the full conference & workshops.  There is no special registration for workshop only.
