The Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Scientific Texts, [SciNLP 2021](https://scinlp.org/), will once again be hosted at [AKBC 2021](https://www.akbc.ws/2021/), as an on-line event. This year's SciNLP focus is on **Understanding Scientific Text**. We welcome submissions of **extended abstracts (1-2 pages only, not including references)** on research areas related to Understanding Scientific Text. Submissions may include previously published results, late-breaking results, and work in progress.

We aim to have 4 invited speakers and a poster session. Relevant submissions will be accepted for the virtual poster session. **The workshop is non-archival**, so participants may also submit their work for publication elsewhere.

- DATE: Oct 7, 2021
- LOCATION: Virtual online event, co-hosted with [AKBC 2021](https://www.akbc.ws/2021/)
- ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DEADLINE: August 20, 2021

# Topics of Interest

The primary goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse fields who are interested in building computational systems that extract, represent the knowledge in scientific texts, and/or provide humans better access to such knowledge. 

Accordingly, the focus of this year’s SciNLP will be **Understanding Scientific Text**, and we welcome discussions about research that falls under this focus area, including those describing work-in-progress. Examples of such research include, but are not limited to:

- **Methods** in natural language processing for extracting and representing knowledge from scientific text (e.g. information extraction, entity normalization, discourse analysis, parsing, knowledge base construction, weak/distant supervision, crowdsourcing), especially in low resource scenarios that are common while processing scientific texts
- **Applications** of these methods to improving scientific knowledge discovery and/or understanding (e.g. summarization, text generation, translation, question answering, automated literature review, search and recommender systems, techniques for data exploration and visualization),
- **Fairness** (e.g. augmented or assistive paper reading, concept simplification, scientific education and literacy),
- **Science of science** studies (in particular, studies that shed light on phenomena that can motivate future research in above-mentioned areas), and
- **Datasets**, **Resources** (e.g. treebanks, knowledge bases), and **Tools** (e.g. software libraries, annotation interfaces) for conducting research in such areas, especially for supporting research in underserved areas (e.g. SciNLP on non-English papers).

We welcome research relevant to processing text in any domain of science (e.g. Biology, Medicine, Computer Science, Physics, Economics, Sociology, etc.) that can come from a variety of text sources (e.g. scholarly papers, surveys and technical reports, patents, tweets by scholars, blogs/tutorials, etc.)

The goal of SciNLP is to promote scientific literature (not just news & wiki) as a serious domain of NLP. We would like the workshop to provide a forum for researchers in this field to discover new advances on scientific text understanding, get feedback on early work, and identify existing research gaps and collaboration opportunities.

# Submission Guidelines

To submit an abstract, please send an email to **scinlp@googlegroups.com** with the subject line “SCINLP submission: [TITLE]”. Please include:

- Abstract in PDF format (1-2 pages max, not including references) as an attachment. Abstracts will be lightly reviewed to ensure that the topic is within the scope of the workshop.
- Indicate which of the authors will be presenting the work. We require each accepted work to provide a **poster describing the work**. We will reach out with poster uploading instructions after acceptance notification.
- Indicate the **scientific domain(s)** and **source(s) of scientific text** relevant to the submission; for example, scientific domain could be “Biology, Genomics” while source of text could be “Peer-reviewed abstracts from PubMed”.

All accepted abstracts (and their posters) will be made available online prior to the workshop and remain accessible afterwards.  See [last year’s abstract submissions](https://scinlp.org/history/2020/#poster-sessions) for examples.

If you require accommodation in order to fully participate in the workshop, please let us know and we’ll be in touch to discuss how we can best address your needs.

# Panel discussion: The role of scientific NLP during an epidemic

In light of the activity from the computing community to help with the current virus epidemic, we felt it important to hold a panel discussion on the role of NLP and text mining over scientific text (in particular biomedical literature).

* What are useful short/long-term endeavors?
* What are we doing that *isn't* helpful?  
* How can we best connect and collaborate with domain experts?
* What are challenges that prevent us from being helpful?

We've invited [Asma Ben Abacha](#asma-ben-abacha), [Hoifung Poon](#hoifung-poon), and [Byron Wallace](#byron-wallace) to share their thoughts and answer questions.

We will be curating questions from the audience beforehand (as well as live during the discussion).

<!--

We welcome submissions of **short abstracts (1 page max)** related to the above research areas. Submissions may include previously published results, late-breaking results, and work in progress.  Relevant submissions will be accepted for **video presentation** in the virtual poster session.  **The workshop is non-archival**, so participants are free to also submit their work for publication elsewhere.

To submit an abstract, please send an email to **scinlp@googlegroups.com** with the subject line "SCINLP submission: [TITLE]". Please include:
        
* Abstract in PDF format (1-page max) as an attachment.  Abstracts will be lightly reviewed to ensure that the topic is within the scope of the workshop.
* Indicate which of the authors will be presenting the work.  We require each accepted work to provide a **~2 minute video** recording of the presentation.  We will reach out with video uploading instructions *after* acceptance notification.  Video length requirements may change depending on the number of submissions.
* Indicate the scientific domain(s) and source(s) of scientific text relevant to the submission; for example, scientific domain could be “Genomics” while source of text could be “Peer-reviewed papers from PubMed”.

**Writing guidelines:**  These abstracts can be longer than the typical abstracts for a full research paper.  Figures and tables are allowed, but will count toward the length limit.  References will *not* count toward the length limit.  Abstracts do not have to be about a single paper; we allow abstracts that summarize a collection of works under a unified theme (e.g., a series of closely-related papers that build on each other or tackle a common problem).  **For writing examples, see the accepted abstracts from last year's [SLKB](https://sites.google.com/view/akbc-sci/home#h.p_gSgV1fypJAMf) workshop at AKBC 2019.** 

All accepted abstracts (and their videos) will be made available online prior to the workshop and remain accessible afterwards.

If you have a disability and require accommodation in order to fully participate in the workshop, please let us know and we'll be in touch to discuss how we can best address your needs.

# About


The primary goal of this half-day workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse fields
who are interested in extracting and representing knowledge from scientific text, and/or
applications or methods for improving access to and understanding of such knowledge. Such
research includes, but is not limited to:

* **Methods** in natural language processing and data mining for extracting and representing
knowledge from scientific text (e.g. information extraction, entity normalization, discourse
analysis, parsing, summarization, text generation, question answering, knowledge base
construction, weak/distant supervision, crowdsourcing),
* **Applications** of these methods to improving scientific knowledge discovery and/or
understanding (e.g. automated literature review, search and recommender systems,
techniques for data exploration and visualization),
* **Fairness** (e.g. augmented or assistive paper reading, concept simplification, scientific
education and literacy),
* **Science of science** studies (in particular, studies that shed light on phenomena that can
motivate future research in above-mentioned areas), and
* **Datasets**, **Resources** (e.g. treebanks, knowledge bases), and **Tools** (e.g. software
libraries, annotation interfaces) for conducting research in such areas.

We welcome research relevant to processing text in any domain of science (e.g. Biology,
Medicine, Computer Science, Physics, Economics, Sociology, etc.) that can come from a
variety of text sources (e.g. scholarly papers, surveys and technical reports, patents, tweets
by scholars, blogs/tutorials, etc.)
